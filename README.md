# PicVault

A full-stack image hosting starter built with Vue 3, Element Plus, NestJS, PostgreSQL, Redis, BullMQ, sharp, and S3-compatible object storage.

## Stack

- Frontend: Vue 3, Vite, Element Plus, Pinia, Vue Router
- Backend: NestJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Redis, BullMQ, sharp
- Storage: third-party S3-compatible object storage, with optional local disk storage
- Deployment base: Docker Compose

## Production Deploy

After the repository is pushed to GitHub, deploy from a VPS with Docker and Docker Compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_NAME/YOUR_REPO.git image-bed
cd image-bed
cp .env.production.example .env

# edit .env before first start
nano .env

docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:7899/healthz
```

Frontend: `http://SERVER_IP:7899`

Backend API: proxied at `/api`.

Swagger is disabled by default. Set `ENABLE_SWAGGER=true` only for trusted environments.

PostgreSQL, Redis, and the backend are internal Compose services and are not exposed to the public host.

Configure a third-party S3-compatible provider in `.env` or in Control Center before using object-storage uploads. Supported examples include Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, Alibaba OSS S3-compatible endpoints, Tencent COS S3-compatible endpoints, and other compatible services. The bucket must allow browser `PUT` requests through CORS.

To update an existing deployment:

```bash
cd image-bed
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
```

To back up PostgreSQL and local storage:

```bash
bash scripts/backup.sh
```

## Local Development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
npm install
docker compose up -d postgres redis
npm run prisma:migrate -w backend
npm run start:dev -w backend
npm run dev -w frontend
```

## Notes

- The first registered user automatically becomes `ADMIN`.
- Uploads use presigned PUT URLs, so the browser sends image bytes directly to the configured object-storage provider.
- The image processing queue is wired with BullMQ and sharp; the current worker marks uploaded images as ready and is the extension point for thumbnails, WebP/AVIF, watermarks, and moderation.
- Prisma is pinned to v6 because Prisma v7 changes datasource configuration and requires a different setup.
